### Opinion on styling using emotionJS/Css in Js
Never used styled components before and overall the expierence was pretty good. 
Was super nice to not have to switch between a css and js file to edit styles.
Did get a bit annoying when I was refactoring or removing divs since those styles are 
binded to a styled component above.

Would I use css in js again, yes but only if I couldn't use a library like tailwind css
